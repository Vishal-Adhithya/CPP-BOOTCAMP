//object oriented programming...
// inheritance is used to write less code and to reuse a existing code...
// whenever you right a class it is called as base class...

 // public can access by everyone...
// private cannot be access by everyone also to the derived class...
// protected can be access to base and derived class but not for others...

//abstraction:
//            ...
// the detail we should not know...
// abstraction hides the layer of ununecessary information form the user and provides a single point of access to execute a set of statements..
// data members:
        
//  constructors are called automatically at the object initialization stage, and destructors will delete the object from memory. Virtual methods are overridden in child class, so none of thes can be ingerited other than date member.
//
//rule of three:
//              by defintion, if we have to explicitly declare either the desturctor, copy constructor or copy assignment operator we need to explicitly declasre all three of them..        
//      
//this keyword:

// refers to the current instance of the class
